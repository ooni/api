=== Integration tests

Integration tests are run against a Clickhouse or PostgreSQL database

They require a readonly and read-write user

The --create-db flag will:
 * create DB schemas

 * run the fastpath on a fixed date:
   * populate the fastpath table with deterministic data from the past

 * import citizenlab test list from github

The --inject-msmts flag will:
 * run the API to receive as set of artificial fresh measurements simulating msmt upload
   * populate the fastpath table with partially deterministic data
     * this trigger updates to Clickhouse materialized views and allow testing URL prioritization

   * run the measurement uploader to populate the jsonl table
     * do not write to S3

Multiple runs of --inject-msmts *may* add new data. Tests should be written to pass if one or more runs have been done.


Use --show-capture=no to avoid multiple log chunks
Use -s to show logs in real time
